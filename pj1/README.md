An interactive google cloud function used a machine learning model (Random Forest).

**Step 1**: Build the Random Forest Prediction model on the California House Price.

**Step 2**: Upload the "model.pkl" to Google Cloud Bucket.

**Step 3**: Deploy the Google Cloud Function using the model and predict the house price, use the instance post by the users.

**Step 4**: Try a call_function_demo to test your google cloud function.

**Step 5**: Build an interactive interface to get input from users using widgets package.

**Step 6**: Use Google Colab to run the "interactive_interface.ipynb" (try download it from github, you can use the code in google colab.py) and share the link.
